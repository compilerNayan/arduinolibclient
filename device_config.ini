# Device Hardware Configuration File
# 
# This file defines the GPIO pin assignments for devices and their relay controllers.
# Currently supports switches, but can be extended for other device types (regulators, etc.) in the future.
# 
# Format:
#   [Switch_N]
#   relay_pin = <GPIO pin number for relay control (output)>
#   physical_pin = <GPIO pin number for reading physical device state (input)>
#
# Only switches with both pins defined will be initialized.
# Comment lines start with # and are ignored.
#
# Example:
#   [Switch_1]
#   relay_pin = 101
#   physical_pin = 201

[Switch_1]
relay_pin = 25
physical_pin = 34

[Switch_2]
relay_pin = 26
physical_pin = 35

[Switch_3]
relay_pin = 27
physical_pin = 32

[Switch_4]
relay_pin = 14
physical_pin = 33

# Add more switches below as needed (Switch_4 through Switch_100)
# Uncomment and modify the pin numbers for the switches you want to use:
#
# [Switch_4]
# relay_pin = 104
# physical_pin = 204
#
# [Switch_5]
# relay_pin = 105
# physical_pin = 205
